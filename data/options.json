Any chapter amount can be used with this goal.\nEscape Spellhold - Reach Chapter 4 and complete it (excludes City of Caverns).\nDefeat Red Dragon Firkraag - Reach Chapter 6 and defeat Firkraag. You can complete this sooner but the logic expects Chapter 6 to ensure you're properly equipped.\nDefeat Kangaxx the Demilich - Reach Chapter 6 and defeat Kangaxx. You can complete this sooner but the logic expects Chapter 6 to ensure you're properly equipped.\nDefeat Jon Irenicus - Reach Chapter 7 and defeat Irenicus at the Tree of Life\nPlease ensure you have the required chapters enabled below if you're choosing a late chapter goal or it won't generate.",
