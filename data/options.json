More required tokens makes for a longer game. Any chapter amount can be used with this goal. \n 2. Escape Spellhold - Reach Chapter 4 and complete it (excludes City of Caverns). \n 3. Defeat Firkraag or Kangaxx - Reach Chapter 6 and defeat Firkraag or Kangaxx. You can complete this sooner but the logic expects Chapter 6 to ensure you're properly equipped. \n 4. Defeat Jon Irenicus - Reach Chapter 7 and defeat Irenicus at the Tree of Life.",
