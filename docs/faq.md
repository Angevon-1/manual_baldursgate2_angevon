## FAQ for common issues using Baldur's Gate 2 manual

## How do you progress the game in this manual?

Regions in the game are locked by “unlock” items created by the manual system. For example, you can’t go to the Graveyard District until you’ve received “Graveyard District Unlock.” These items are not actual in-game items; keep an eye on the received items side of the Manual Client to see which of these unlocks you have received from the multiworld.
Note: Irenicus’s Dungeon and Waukeen’s Promenade are considered always available and don’t have associated unlock items.

## What loot can I pick up in the game?

Genrally, non-magical equipment, ammunition, gems, gold, potions, and scrolls are free for all. Pick them up as you see fit. Key items and magical equipment depend on your "Ways to play this manual" choice in the [readme](BG2_readme.md).

## I’ve received a region unlock, but it's greyed out and “unavailable” on the world map!

In the normal game, for some areas outside of the big city, you have to visit the City Gates and exit from the gate to un-grey them. The manual system plans for this and you are logically supposed to receive City Gates Unlock before you can visit those areas. However, if you’re fine with using the cheat console, you may also just use the MoveToArea cheat console command. Mike's RPGcenter has [a list](https://mikesrpgcenter.com/bgate2/cheats.html) of the important area codes.<br/>

Remember, the logic does NOT expect use of the cheat console. This is purely if you want to. 

## I left Irenicus’s Dungeon too early! I missed some location checks!
If you didn’t enable the Skip Irenicus Dungeon option, then you’ll need to use the cheat console to MoveToArea back there and finish. The area cose is AR0602. So you'd use<br>
CLUAConsole:MovetoArea('AR0602')<br>
or C:MovetoArea('AR0602') for enhanced edition (or just click it in the area list that pops up in the EE's cheat console menu)<br>
Alternatively, no one is stopping you from clicking all the Irenicus Dungeon locations in the Manual Client.

## How do I spawn the Unseeing Eye?

You need both Rift Device parts (MISC5A and MISC5B), and you must be in the Pit of the Faithless.
