## What is a video game randomizer?
Let’s say you’re playing an adventure video game. You’re exploring the world, and find a cave. You explore the cave and find a treasure chest. You open the chest and find a sword. You can now use the sword to clear the vines that were blocking an earlier part of the cave.

And that’s how this particular game is intended to be played. If you were to start a new file in the game and start all over, you’ll have to go to that same cave and find your sword. Your sword will always be in that chest in that cave, and you’d be expected to use it to clear the vines.

A randomizer (usually) tries to change things up by changing what’s expected. So, instead of your sword, that chest might have a bow. Maybe instead of using a sword to clear the vines, you’ll be expected to use fire arrows from the bow to burn them away.

The appeal of randomizers is that you never know what you’ll find in a chest, and that you might be expected to complete puzzles or approach combat in unconventional ways since you won't always have the items you normally would. It adds a new twist to a game you’ve already played. 
 
## What is Archipelago?
Archipelago (https://archipelago.gg/) is, at its most basic level, a randomizer. It can randomize supported games as explained above. Supported games are on the supported games list (https://archipelago.gg/games), check it out!

But it can also take things a step further. For example, you can randomize more than one game together, with each other. If you set it up right, you can play both Zelda, and, say, Super Mario World, and randomize them together. Now, perhaps that chest with a sword now contains an extra life for Mario. Maybe when the Mario game clears a level, it'll send some arrows to the Zelda game. If both games are being played at the same time, due to the magic of the Archipelago system, the sending/receiving of these items even happens in real time for a seamless experience. 

Each 'game' in Archipelago is called a 'world', and when there are multiple games/worlds being played, it's called a multiworld. Additionally, the worlds don't have to be different games. You can create a multiworld with 5 worlds that are all each Zelda: Ocarina of Time, for example. Now your first Ocarina of Time world's sword might be in the 4th Ocarina of Time world's Deku Tree Compass Chest. This can create complex puzzles for you to solve in order to beat all the games in your multiworld!

There's a lot more that Archipelago can do, but that's the basic idea.

## What is a manual?
Obviously, not all games are on the supported games list. Manual is a system that can be used to create a simple implementation for games not on the list. Generally, when someone is 'making a manual', they create a list of items in the game (sword, bow, money, arrows, etc.), and a list of locations to find items in (treasure chests, quest rewards, etc.). Then, when the manual game is included in a multiworld, Archipelago will randomize the manual game's items across all the worlds in the multiworld. Then, when playing the manual, the tasks of marking which locations you've checked, and limiting your item use based on what items you've received, are all performed by you (the player) via the honor system. You <i>manually</i> track both of these via the Manual Client which can be accessed from the Archipelago Launcher. 

For example, after you open a specific treasure chest, you press the button in the Manual Client that says "I opened X chest", and the Archipelago system will figure out what item was there and send it out to whoever it belongs to.

As with Archipelago, there's a lot more that Manual can do, but that's the basic idea.
